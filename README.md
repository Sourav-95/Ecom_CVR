# Online_Store_Analysis
This project is divided into two parts. In the 1st part we are going to analyze:
Ecommerce Website Traffic Analysis for Conversion Rate from sessions to orders & quantifying the impact of Revenue Generation.
<br> In this project we have initially looked into the traffic generating source. Next we have dig into the monthly trend of that particular source to check the Conversion Rate.
Other than source we need to also focus on the paid campaigns. 
<br> Hence we fetched the report for that particular source by segmenting into campaigns.
<br>'Gsearch Non brand' campaigns were driving the traffic of the website. Device type also can reveal a lot more information to marketing managers.
<br>So we filtered out 'Gsearch Nonbrand' Traffic with segmenting into different 'Device Type'
<br>Optimizing methods was implemented by introducing a new landing page 'lander-1' to improve the customer experience and conversion rate.
<br>Hence we created a report to audit the performance of the new landing page with respect to the old landing page 'home'
<br>As we move to the next step, understanding the journey of a customer was very important to optimize the critical pain point of abandoning. 
<br>Converers Funnel Analysis gives us the inference of these optimizing methods
<br>'billing-2' was another billing page introduced to improve the conversion rate. Hence we also need to check the performance.
